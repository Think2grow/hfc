An emergency fund is your financial safety net. Here’s how to build one, how much to save, and why it matters.

## What Is an Emergency Fund?
Money set aside for unexpected expenses—car repairs, medical bills, job loss, etc. It keeps you from going into debt when life happens.

## How Much Should You Save?
- **Starter goal:** $500–$1,000 (for small emergencies)
- **Long-term goal:** 3–6 months of living expenses

## Where to Keep It
- Separate savings account (easy to access, but not too easy)
- Avoid using your checking account

## How to Build It
1. Set a small, realistic goal
2. Automate transfers each payday
3. Use windfalls (tax refunds, bonuses) to boost your fund
4. Celebrate progress—every dollar counts!

## When to Use It
Only for true emergencies—not for planned expenses or wants.
