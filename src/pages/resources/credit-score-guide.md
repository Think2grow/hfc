Your credit score impacts many areas of your life. Learn what affects your score and how to build it up.

## What Is a Credit Score?
A number (usually 300–850) that shows how likely you are to repay borrowed money. Lenders use it to decide if you qualify for loans, credit cards, etc.

## What Affects Your Score?
- Payment history (on-time payments matter most)
- Amounts owed (credit utilization)
- Length of credit history
- New credit (recent applications)
- Types of credit used

## How to Improve Your Score
1. Pay bills on time, every time
2. Keep credit card balances low
3. Don’t open too many new accounts at once
4. Check your credit report for errors

You can check your score for free once a year at AnnualCreditReport.com (U.S.).
