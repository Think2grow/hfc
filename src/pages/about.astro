      <SectionHeading title="My Story" subtitle="How I became passionate about financial coaching" />
      <div class="mt-12 space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          I didn't start out as a financial expert. Like many people, I've faced my own money challenges—uncertainty about the future, stress over decisions, and the overwhelming feeling of not knowing where to start. Those experiences taught me something important: <strong>everyone deserves a partner on their financial journey.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of navigating my own financial path and helping friends and family find clarity, I realized financial coaching was my calling. I founded Highline Financial Coaching to create a judgment-free space where real people can get real support—no sales pitches, no hidden agendas, just education and accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pursued my AFC® (Accredited Financial Counselor) certification, joined the Association for Financial Counseling & Planning Education, and committed to ongoing learning. But beyond the credentials, what drives me is simple: <strong>I believe financial stress shouldn't hold you back from living the life you want.</strong>

            I'll show up with empathy, honesty, and practical guidance. I'll meet you where you are, help you create a plan that fits your life, and celebrate your progress every step of the way. Your success is my success.
