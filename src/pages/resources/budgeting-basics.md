Budgeting is the foundation of financial clarity. In this article, you’ll learn how to create a budget you can actually stick to, plus tips for making it work in real life.

## Why Budget?
Budgeting helps you:
- See where your money goes
- Make intentional choices
- Reduce stress and avoid surprises
- Reach your goals faster

## How to Start a Budget
1. **List your income.** Add up all sources of money you receive each month.
2. **List your expenses.** Write down everything you spend money on—fixed (rent, utilities) and variable (groceries, fun).
3. **Categorize and total.** Group expenses and see how much goes to each area.
4. **Compare income and expenses.** If you spend more than you make, look for areas to cut back.
5. **Set goals.** Decide what you want to change or improve (save more, pay off debt, etc.).
6. **Track and adjust.** Review your budget weekly. Adjust as needed—real life changes!

## Tips for Sticking With It
- Use a simple tool (spreadsheet, app, or paper)
- Automate savings and bills when possible
- Celebrate small wins
- Don’t aim for perfection—aim for progress
