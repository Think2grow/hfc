Your mindset matters. Learn how to identify limiting beliefs and build a healthier relationship with money.

## What Is a Money Mindset?
Your beliefs and attitudes about money—often shaped by childhood, culture, and past experiences.

## Common Limiting Beliefs
- “I’m just bad with money.”
- “I’ll never get ahead.”
- “Money is stressful.”

## How to Shift Your Mindset
1. Notice your self-talk about money
2. Challenge negative beliefs—are they really true?
3. Replace with empowering thoughts ("I can learn new skills," "Progress is possible")
4. Surround yourself with positive influences

## Practice Gratitude
Focus on what you have, not just what you lack. Gratitude can reduce stress and help you make better decisions.
